# College's Predictive Basketball Profit
by Standard Deviants

## Summary
[Add a one paragraph summary of your final project.]
In our research project, we investigated the factors influencing the profit generated by collegiate basketball in the 2019 school year using a dataset from Tidy Tuesday.
Our primary research question centered around forecasting the profit (calculated as revenue - expenditure) in USD for collegiate basketball during the school year 2018 using factors such as participation rate, school sector name, gender ratio, total count of students, percent of expenditures towards women's sports, and school classification name. 
We used a multiple linear regression with a log-transformed profit variable, and based on the p values, the three significant predictors were total participation rate, total count of students, and percentage of women participation. However, our final model had a fairly low r-square and high rmse indicating that our model is not a good predictive model. In terms of future work, we would like to extend the scope of our research to predict longitudinal trends within collegiate basketball profitability by analyzing data spanning multiple sessions. We anticipate the implications of our research predicting profit generation in collegiate basketball holds profound meaning in domains such as sports management and educational governance to foster a conducive environment for student-athletes.
